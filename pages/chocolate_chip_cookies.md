# Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 cups flour
* 3 tbs cornstarch
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 6 tbs white sugar
* 6 tbs brown sugar
* 1/2 cup butter, cold (e.g. one stick)
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 tsp vanilla
* approx 1.5 cups total chocolate chips, et. al.

## Steps

0. After each ingredient is added, continue mixing.
1. Into a medium bowl, crack the egg.
2. Add the 12 tbs sugar.
3. Add the butter in small pieces (1/2 - 1 tbs).
4. Add the 1/2 tsp vanilla.
5. Add the 1/2 tsp baking soda.
6. Add 3 tbs cornstarch.
7. Add 1 1/4 cups flour.
8. After a minute or two the dough will be evenly mixed. Stop the mixer.
9. Add the chocolate chips, Reece's Pieces, nuts, or other add-ins.  The total of add-ins should be approximately 1.5 cups.
10. Knead the add-ins into the dough by hand.
11. Transfer the dough to the fridge to chill.
12. Set the oven to 400F.
13. While the oven is heating, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.
14. Grab or spoon cookie dough into balls at least as big as 1 tbs; larger is fine.
15. Put the cookies in the oven and set a timer for 9 minutes.
16. After 9 minutes, the cookies may be done or not (lightly browned on top).  If not, add a few minutes and monitor them.  The total time will be longer the larger the cookies are.
17. When they are done, remove from the oven, but let them cool on the baking sheet.
