# White Chicken Chili

I mess around with the amounts and ingredients a lot.  It's pretty flexible.  Enjoy!

## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 ( 4 ounce ) can diced jalepeno peppers
    * I usually replace this with 2 fresh jalapenos and 2 serranos
* 1 ( 4 ounce ) can chopped green chile peppers
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp ground cayenne pepper
* 2 ( 14.5 ounce ) cans/boxes chicken broth
* 3 cups chopped cooked chicken breast
    * I usually saute it in some oil and then shred it with two forks
* 3 ( 15 ounce ) cans white beans (e.g. great northern beans)
* 1 cup shredded monterey jack cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan or pot over medium-low heat.  Slowly cook and stir the onion til tender.
2. Mix in the garlic, jalepeno, green chile peppers, cumin, oregano, and cayenne.   Continue to cook and stir the mixture until tender, about 3 minutes.
3. mix in the chicken broth, chicken and white beans.  ( I usually drain/rinse the beans a little, but it doesn't matter either way. )
4. Simmer 15 - 60 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Remove mixture from heat, mix in cheese.
6. Serve with oyster crackers ( or goldfish! ) and more shredded cheese.  Sour cream, hot sauce (Cholula), fresh cilantro also welcome.
