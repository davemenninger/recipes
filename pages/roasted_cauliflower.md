| 4 - 6 Servings | 5 mins.   | 30 mins.   |

## Ingredients

* large head cauliflower (about 2 1/2 lbs.)
* 1 tbsp. olive oil
* 2 tbsp. salted butter, melted
* 1 tsp. seasoned salt
* 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
* 2 tbsp. shaved parmesan cheese, optional
* 1 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley, optional

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Cut the cauliflower into 2-inch pieces, about 1/2-inch thick.
3. Place the cauliflower pieces on the sheet tray. Drizzle with the olive oil and butter, and sprinkle with the seasoned salt and pepper. Mix well to thoroughly coat the cauliflower. Spread into a single layer.
4. Roast until the cauliflower starts to brown and the stems are tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and toss with the parmesan cheese and parsley, if using.

> Tip: Line the sheet pan with aluminum foil for easy clean up—it will conduct heat and roast the cauliflower exactly like it is directly on the pan!

### Should you rinse cauliflower before cooking?

Yep! Give the cauliflower a good rinse to clean off any dirt or grit before you cut it up and cook it. Use a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to dry it well before proceeding.

### How do you cut cauliflower for roasting?

You'll need to cut it into florets. The easiest way to do this is to cut the head of cauliflower in half. Next, cut out the core. Then, you can easily break or cut the cauliflower into florets. The most important thing to remember is to cut the cauliflower into evenly sized pieces so that it roasts evenly. Shoot for about 2-inch pieces that are around 1/2-inch thick.

### How do you make crispy roasted cauliflower?

There are a couple of tricks to making cauliflower extra crispy when roasting. First, make sure your oven is hot. Roast the cauliflower at 425 degrees to give it enough heat to crisp up. Second, the secret is in how you cut it! Make sure at least one side of the cauliflower is cut flat, giving it maximum contact with the sheet pan. This will allow the whole bottom side to deeply caramelize resulting in crispness and tons of flavor.

### Why does my roasted cauliflower get mushy?

Use the largest baking sheet that you have to roast cauliflower. When it is crowded onto a small pan, the cauliflower will steam and soften, rather than baking up nice and crispy. If washing cauliflower florets before roasting, be sure to dry completely.

### How long does roast cauliflower last?

If covered and stored in a cool, dry part of the refrigerator, raw cauliflower will stay fresh for about two weeks. Once roasted, it's best to eat within three days. To crisp up before eating, return to a sheet tray in a single layer and bake for three to five minutes at 425 degrees.
